            "{'Overall Pitch Score': 85, 'Strengths': 'The pitch deck template provides a well-structured and comprehensive outline covering all essential sections for a startup pitch. It logically progresses from problem to solution, market, business model, and team. The inclusion of expert quotes and tips throughout the template adds credibility and practical guidance. The emphasis on customer pain, market sizing, competitive advantage, and financial viability is strong. It encourages a focus on key metrics and realistic assumptions.', 'Weaknesses': \"While comprehensive, the template is somewhat generic and lacks specific guidance on visual presentation and storytelling. Some sections could benefit from more detailed prompts to ensure deeper thinking (e.g., 'Go-to-Market Strategy' is broad). It doesn't explicitly emphasize the need for a compelling narrative or emotional connection.  The 'Financial Snapshot' could be more specific about key financial metrics beyond revenue and net income. There's no guidance on slide count for a 10-minute presentation.\", 'Improvement Suggestions': \"Enhance visual storytelling guidance by suggesting incorporating more visuals, charts, and less text per slide. Add more specific prompting questions within each section to guide deeper analysis and detail (e.g., in 'Go-to-Market,' ask about specific channels and customer acquisition cost).  Recommend including key financial metrics beyond revenue and net income (like CAC, LTV, burn rate). Suggest a target slide count for a 10-minute pitch.  Explicitly emphasize the importance of weaving a compelling narrative throughout the presentation to create an emotional connection and make the pitch more memorable. Consider adding a section on 'Traction' to showcase early validation or user growth.\"}\n",

            "{'Overall Pitch Score': 75, 'Strengths': \"Clearly articulates the problem and solution, supported by market validation data from Couchsurfing and Craigslist.  The business model is simple and easy to understand (10% commission). The deck effectively highlights key competitive advantages like 'First to Market' and 'Ease of Use'. Market size is quantified, demonstrating a large potential opportunity.\", 'Weaknesses': \"The 'Product' slide is extremely basic and lacks detail about features and user experience. There are inconsistencies in the 'Business Model' slide regarding revenue calculations (AVG FEE and REVENUE figures are misaligned). The 'Competitive Advantages' slide contains unprofessional 'Lorem Ipsum' filler text instead of detailed explanations. Market size definitions (TAM, SAM, Market Share) could be clearer, and the 'Market Share' calculation label 'TRIPS W/AB&B' is confusing.  'Market Adoption' strategies are listed but lack depth and specific execution plans.\", 'Improvement Suggestions': \"Enhance the 'Product' slide with more detail about key features, user interface, and user flow to showcase the platform's value proposition. Correct the inconsistencies in the 'Business Model' slide calculations to ensure accuracy and credibility. Replace the 'Lorem Ipsum' text in 'Competitive Advantages' with concrete explanations of each advantage and how they will be leveraged. Clearly define TAM, SAM, and Market Share on the 'Market Size' slide and refine the 'Market Share' label for better understanding. Elaborate on 'Market Adoption' strategies by providing more specific tactics and timelines for execution. Consider adding a slide on the team and financial projections for a more comprehensive pitch.\"}\n"
